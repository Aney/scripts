# Test Install

Using a VM and other thinkpad to decide what I can remove/add.

The idea is to get full functionality, but also be minimal and lightweight.

# OS

Debian, minimal net install. 

Only select `standard system utilities` or whatever it's called.

This can be skipped and stuff installed as needed also

# non-free

- firmware-iwlwifi
	- For thinkpad wifi card

# Errything else

- sudo
	- `su -`, `adduser <USER> sudo`, then relog as the user.
- tmux
- htop
- neofetch
- git
- wget 
- build-essential
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
